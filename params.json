{"name":"Skipify","tagline":"Quickly skip songs in Spotify (Mac) using a keystroke","body":"### What's Skipfiy?\r\nSimply put, Skipify allows you to assign a hotkey to skip to the next song in Spotify. It can be used **even when Spotify is in the background** (ex: I'm browsing in Chrome and too lazy to switch to Spotify and click a button - I know this isn't just me).\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n1. Double click the Skipify file you just unzipped from the download to open it up and install it as a \"Service\".\r\n--screenshot here--\r\n2. Go to **System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts**.\r\n--screenshot here--\r\n\r\n3. Select **Services** from the left column.\r\n--screenshot here--\r\n\r\n4. Scroll down to the bottom of the list, under the **General** tab.\r\n\r\n5. Click the **add shortcut** button next to the line with **Skipify**.\r\n\r\n6. Hold down your preferred shortcut. I use **CTRL-CMD-]**, since that's what I use to go forward a page when in Chrome. _Make sure the shortcut isn't used by another application first!_\r\n\r\n7. That's it! You can make sure it's running by going in the toolbar to **[Application] > Services** and it should say **Skipify** with the blue icon next to it.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@bucktower created this one night. That's about it.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNeed help? I thought I laid out the instructions pretty clearly, but apparently not. File an issue on the repo.\r\n\r\nMy email is bucktower14@gmail.com for anything else.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
